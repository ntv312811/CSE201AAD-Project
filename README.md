                                       ROUND-ROBIN TIME SCHEDULING
STATEMENT: UNIX Operating system uses round robin time slicing with multilevel feedback for process scheduling. Assume that the processes arrive at random. assume that the processes (PCBâ€™s)arrive at random. Assume that time slice is 3 units. Simulate Round robin time slicing with fixed and variable (Randomized) burst times. Run the processes for fixed amount of time and find the average waiting time, average turn-around time of the processes completed.

EXPLANATION:Round robin scheduling Algorithm is designed especially for time sharing systems. Preemption is added to enable the system to switch between process. A small unit of time called time quantum/slice is defined. A time quantum is generally from 10-100(ms)in length. During time quantum each process is allowed to run if process is still running at the end of the quantum, the CPU is pre-empted and given to another process has blocked/finished before the quantum has elapsed, the CPU switching is done.

ALGORITHM:
1.Create an array rem_bt[] to keep track of remaining
burst time of processes. This array is initially a
copy of bt[] (burst times array)
2- Create another array wt[] to store waiting times
of processes. Initialize this array as 0.
3- Initialize time : t = 0
4- Keep traversing the all processes while all processes
are not done. Do following for i&#39;th process if it is

not done yet.
a- If rem_bt[i] &gt; quantum
(i) t = t + quantum
(ii) bt_rem[i] -= quantum;
c- Else // Last cycle for this process
(i) t = t + bt_rem[i];
(ii) wt[i] = t - bt[i]
(ii) bt_rem[i] = 0;
